### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'am Jake Brockbank, from Canada, and I do website and mobile app development. I enjoy learning about new languages and frameworks that I can utilize to make the best products possible. Some of my favorite languages are JavaScript, C, C#, SQL, Java, etc. You can check me out on https://www.instagram.com/jaketgm/ or https://www.facebook.com/AqueousOfficial.
